			Where does it come from? Contrary to popular belief, Lorem
			Ipsum is not simply random text. It has roots in a piece of classical
			Latin literature from 45 BC, making it over 2000 years old. Richard
			McClintock, a Latin professor at Hampden-Sydney College in Virginia,
			looked up one of the more obscure Latin words, consectetur, from a
			Lorem Ipsum passage, and going through the cites of the word in
			classical literature, discovered the undoubtable source. Lorem Ipsum
			comes from sections 1.10.32 and 1.10.33 of "de Finibus Bonorum et
			Malorum" (The Extremes of Good and Evil) by Cicero, written in 45 BC.
			This book is a treatise on the theory of ethics, very popular during
			the Renaissance. The first line of Lorem Ipsum, "Lorem ipsum dolor
			sit amet..", comes from a line in section 1.10.32. The standard chunk
			of Lorem Ipsum used since the 1500s is reproduced below for those
			interested. Sections 1.10.32 and 1.10.33 from "de Finibus Bonorum et
			Malorum" by Cicero are also reproduced in their exact original form,
			accompanied by English versions from the 1914 translation by H.
			Rackham.
